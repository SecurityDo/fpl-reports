== AWS Cloudwatch LogGroup event export 

There are three ways to export logs from a log group to an S3 bucket/SIEM/Data Lake or any other destinations.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/SubscriptionFilters.html[AWS Documentation]

* Subscription filters with Kinesis Data Streams
* Subscription filters with Amazon Data Firehose
* Subscription filters with AWS Lambda

Fluency Platform support all three methods. 

=== Subscription filters with Amazon Data Firehose

* Step 1: Setup IAM Roles for Cloudwatch and Firehose service. 
** Create a S3 bucket to hold the loggroup data. (shared by all loggroups)
** Create a new IAM role, allow Firehose to write to S3 bucket.
** Create a new IAM role, allow Cloudwatch to write to Firehose stream.
** Create a new IAM user for Fluency Platform. Allow Fluency to read from the S3 bucket.
** https://fluency-cloudformation.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/FluencyCloudWatchFirehose.yaml[Cloudformation Template]
** Cloudformation Parameters: 
*** CloudWatchRole:  fluencyCloudwatchToFireHose 
*** FirehoseRole: fluencyFireHoseToS3
*** S3Bucket: {yourcompany}-fluency-cloudwatch-firehose
*** IAMUserForFluency: fluency-s3-read

* Step 2: Add Loggroup one by one 
** Create a new Firehose stream.
** Create a new subscription filter for the loggroup, set the destination to the Firehose stream.
** https://fluency-cloudformation.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/FluencyCloudWatchSubscriptionFilter.yaml[Cloudformation Template]
** Cloudformation Parameters:
*** CloudWatchRole:  fluencyCloudwatchToFireHose 
*** FilterName: passthrough
*** FilterPattern: ""
*** FirehoseRole: fluencyFireHoseToS3
*** LogGroup:  
*** S3Bucket: {yourcompany}-fluency-cloudwatch-firehose
*** Name:    //S3 object Prefix

* Pros:
** Easy to setup
** Cheaper than Kinesis data stream
* Cons:
** One firehose for one destination
** Limited destination options

=== Subscription filters with Kinesis Data Streams

* Pros:
** Easy to setup
** Flexible destination options
** 24 hours data retention
* Cons:
** More expensive (each stream cost $0.10 per hour plus data ingress cost)

=== Subscription filters with Lambda

* Pros:
** Flexible destination options
** Cheapest solution. Only pay lambda invocation cost
* Cons:
** More complex setup
