To execute:
- copy the fpl1 code to be converted into the fpl1.txt file
- run node fpl_convert.js on the command line
- the output will be in fpl2.txt file

Notes:
- does not support query as env variable. Need to move query fields into the search line insteat
  - query=sContent("", "") => search sContent("", "")
- add use TABLENAME as default table is not supported. Require the code block to be in the following format:
  - use TABLENAME ... export OUTPUTTABLENAME
- if code fails to execute in fpl1, the conversion may fail or the output code in fpl2 will also fail to compile
- only support join, aggregate, sort, let statement conversions
